# üöÄ Telegram Auto react Userbot (Telethon)

A simple Telegram userbot built with Telethon that automatically reacts to all new messages ‚Äî including text, stickers, GIFs, media, files, and albums ‚Äî in specified channels or groups using predefined emojis.
The bot runs automatically as soon as it is self-hosted or deployed, without requiring any manual commands.
It also works in private chats ‚Äî if you add one or more user IDs to the environment variable, the bot will automatically react to their messages in PMs.
You can include multiple IDs separated by commas to make it react in multiple channels, groups, or individual chats simultaneously.



## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

### 1. Get Telegram API Credentials
1. Go to [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org).  
2. Log in with your Telegram account.  
3. Create a new app ‚Üí copy your **API ID** and **API Hash**.  

---


### 2. Generate Session File
You need a Telegram session file (`autoreact_bot.session`) before deployment.

Create a file called `generate_session.py` with this code:


```python
from telethon import TelegramClient
from telethon.sessions import StringSession

api_id = int(input("Enter your API_ID: "))
api_hash = input("Enter your API_HASH: ")
session_name = input("Enter your session name: ")

client = TelegramClient(StringSession(), api_id, api_hash)

async def main():
    await client.start()

    # Save session string to file as text
    with open(f"{session_name}.session", "w") as f:
        f.write(client.session.save())

    print(f"‚úÖ Session file generated: {session_name}.session \n")
    print(f"‚úÖ session string generated copy the session string and use it in your environment \n ")
    print(f"üí° Session string:\n{client.session.save()}")

with client:
    client.loop.run_until_complete(main())
```


üìù When you run this script, you will be asked to:

‚¶Å API_ID ‚Üí The numeric ID from my.telegram.org.

‚¶Å API_HASH ‚Üí The secret hash from the same place.

‚¶Å Session name ‚Üí Any name you like (e.g., autoreact_bot).


‚ö° During the first login, you will also provide:

‚¶Å Phone number ‚Üí Your Telegram account number.

‚¶Å OTP ‚Üí One-time password sent via SMS or Telegram app.

‚¶Å 2FA password ‚Üí If two-factor authentication is enabled.


‚úÖ After successful login, this script generates a session string, which is a critical piece for headless deployments:

You must store this session string in your .env file (as SESSION_STRING) or as an environment variable.

Using the session string allows the bot to run without re-entering your phone number, OTP, or 2FA.

Keep the session string private ‚Äî anyone with it can access your Telegram account.


‚ö° Important: To run this bot, you must provide your own API ID, API Hash, and SESSION_STRING. Once stored, the bot can start automatically without further manual login.

## 3. Environment Setup

Before running the userbot, you need to set up a few environment variables.  
These should be set in your hosting platform‚Äôs environment settings.

### Required Variables

| Variable          | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `API_ID`          | Your Telegram **API ID** from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org).   |
| `API_HASH`        | Your Telegram **API Hash** from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org). |
| `SESSION_STRING`  | The session string generated by running the session script locally. This allows the bot to log in without entering your phone number and OTP every time. |
| `TARGET_CHAT_IDS`  |   |

### Example `.env` 

```env
API_ID=123456
API_HASH=abcd1234efgh5678
SESSION_STRING=your_generated_session_string_here
TARGET_CHAT_IDS=-100648383848,-10042638383838,7685497383
```
